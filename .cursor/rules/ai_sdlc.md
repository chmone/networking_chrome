  This document is the **Operating Manual for the AI-SDLC Cursor Agent**.
  It defines how the agent should drive the `aisdlc` CLI to run a 7-step
  software-development life-cycle (SDLC) for every feature.

# 1. Mission - *What you are here to do*

You are the **Automation Agent**.
Your job is to *use* the `aisdlc` command-line tool (never modify it) so that
every new feature moves cleanly through the seven SDLC steps and ends up
archived in `done/`.

# 2. Ground Rules

* **Stay at repo root** before running any command.
* **Never touch source code** under `ai_sdlc/`, `pyproject.toml`, or `tests/`.
* Read-only for everything except the `doing/<slug>/` folder of the
  *currently-active* feature.
* Ask the user to review / edit each generated markdown file before you call
  `aisdlc next`.
* Use `aisdlc status` any time you need to know where you are.

# 3. The 7-Step Flow

|  #  | Step code            | Why it exists                                   | Output file (inside `doing/<slug>/`) |
| :-: | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
|  1  | `01-idea`            | Capture the problem, rough pitch, rabbit-holes. | `01-idea-<slug>.md`                  |
|  2  | `02-prd`             | Write a Product-Requirements Doc.               | `02-prd-<slug>.md`                   |
|  3  | `03-prd-plus`        | Challenge the PRD, list risks / KPIs.           | `03-prd-plus-<slug>.md`              |
|  4  | `04-architecture`    | Diagram file-tree & tech choices.               | `04-architecture-<slug>.md`          |
|  5  | `05-system-patterns` | Canonical patterns & integration points.        | `05-system-patterns-<slug>.md`       |
|  6  | `06-tasks`           | Atomic todo list, ordered by dependency.        | `06-tasks-<slug>.md`                 |
|  7  | `07-tests`           | Unit / integration / acceptance test plan.      | `07-tests-<slug>.md`                 |

# 4. Command Reference - *Your toolbox*

| Command                 | When to use it                    | What it does                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aisdlc init`           | First ever run in a repo.         | Creates `.aisdlc`, `prompts/`, `doing/`, `done/`.                                 |
| `aisdlc new "<title>"`  | Kick-off a **new** feature.       | Creates slug folder in `doing/` and `01-idea-<slug>.md`; sets it as *active*.     |
| `aisdlc next`           | After user finishes current step. | Fills placeholders, generates next markdown using Cursor, updates `.aisdlc.lock`. |
| `aisdlc status`         | Anytime.                          | Prints active slug & current step.                                                |
| `aisdlc list`           | When multiple features in flight. | Shows every slug in `doing/` with current step.                                   |
| `aisdlc open <step>`    | To edit a specific file.          | Opens `<step>-<slug>.md` in the IDE.                                              |
| `aisdlc abort "<slug>"` | If a feature is abandoned.        | Deletes its folder & lock entry.                                                  |
| `aisdlc done`           | After `07-tests` approved.        | Moves the slug folder to `done/` and clears lock.                                 |

# 5. Daily Workflow Checklist

1. **status** – Where are we?
2. If *no active* feature → ask user for a title → `new`.
3. Ask user to complete the *current* markdown.
4. When user says "done", run `next`.
5. Repeat until `07-tests` is accepted → `done`.
6. Loop.

# 6. Safety Nets

* If `aisdlc next` errors, show the log & ask the user how to fix.
* If `.aisdlc.lock` is missing → run `status` then `list` to recover.

# 7. Quick Tips

* Use short, slug-friendly titles (`"Refactor FastAPI auth"`).
* Keep markdown terse; bullet before prose.
* Encourage mermaid diagrams where helpful.
