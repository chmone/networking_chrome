# Product Requirements Document: LinkedIn Chrome Extension Support

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for the "LinkedIn Chrome Extension Support" (codename: "LinkedIn Insight"). This Chrome extension aims to enhance the LinkedIn browsing experience by providing users with an AI-generated "networking score" for profiles they view. This score will help users quickly assess the networking potential of a profile based on their own background (resume/LinkedIn profile) and the viewed profile's data. The initial focus is on creating a functioning Chrome extension with core features, paving the way for full LLM integration.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide users with a quick, data-driven assessment of a LinkedIn profile's networking relevance to them.
*   Reduce the time and subjectivity involved in manually evaluating potential networking contacts.
*   Develop a functional MVP Chrome extension that can scrape LinkedIn profile data and display information.
*   Lay the groundwork for future LLM integration for advanced scoring.

## 3. Target Audience

*   Active LinkedIn users seeking to optimize their networking efforts.
*   Professionals, job seekers, recruiters, and salespersons who frequently use LinkedIn to find and evaluate contacts.
*   Users comfortable with installing and using Chrome extensions.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1. In Scope (MVP)

*   **US-001: User Onboarding & Configuration:**
    *   Allow users to (optionally, if simple to implement for MVP) provide their own LinkedIn profile URL. The primary focus for user context in later LLM integration will be the data scraped from viewed profiles. For MVP, complex handling of user's own resume is deferred. Any user-provided URL will be stored locally.
*   **US-002: LinkedIn Profile Scraping:**
    *   When a user views a LinkedIn profile page, the extension can be manually triggered (e.g., via a browser action button) to scrape publicly visible data from that profile.
    *   Initial scraping will focus on key information like name, headline, current role, company, education, and summary/about section.
*   **US-003: Basic Information Display:**
    *   Upon successful scraping, the extension will display a simple pop-up or overlay showing a confirmation that the profile was "read" and some of the scraped data (e.g., name, headline).
*   **US-004: Extension Icon & Basic UI:**
    *   The extension will have an icon in the Chrome toolbar.
    *   The pop-up/overlay will have a clean, simple, and unobtrusive design.

### 4.2. Out of Scope (MVP - for future consideration)

*   Full LLM integration for generating a numerical networking score.
*   Resume upload and detailed parsing of user's own resume for MVP.
*   Automated scraping (extension will be user-triggered).
*   Storing user data in the cloud.
*   Advanced analytics or history of viewed profiles.
*   Support for browsers other than Chrome.
*   Handling profiles in languages other than English (initially).
*   Direct messaging or interaction features through the extension.
*   Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases (basic error handling for critical paths is in scope).
*   Full accessibility compliance (basic accessibility considerations are in scope, full compliance post-MVP).

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

*   **US-001: User Onboarding & Configuration**
    *   **As a new user, I want a simple way to set up the extension, potentially providing my own LinkedIn profile URL if this helps with future context, so the extension can eventually understand my background for scoring. For MVP, the focus is on the extension functioning with viewed profiles.**
        *   **AC-001.1:** The extension provides a clear interface (e.g., options page or initial pop-up) to (optionally) input a LinkedIn profile URL.
        *   **AC-001.2:** (Deferred for MVP) The extension provides an option to upload a resume file.
        *   **AC-001.3:** Any user-provided URL is stored locally by the extension (e.g., using `chrome.storage.local`).
        *   **AC-001.4:** The user can view and update their stored information (if any was provided).
*   **US-002: LinkedIn Profile Scraping (Manual Trigger)**
    *   **As a user browsing LinkedIn, I want to click a button to make the extension analyze the current profile I am viewing, so I can get insights about that person.**
        *   **AC-002.1:** The extension has a browser action button visible when on LinkedIn.com.
        *   **AC-002.2:** Clicking the button triggers scraping of the active LinkedIn profile page.
        *   **AC-002.3:** The extension can successfully extract at least the name, headline, and summary/about section from a standard LinkedIn profile layout.
        *   **AC-002.4:** A visual indicator shows when scraping is in progress.
        *   **AC-002.5:** Errors during scraping (e.g., not on a profile page, critical failure in reading basic structure) are communicated clearly to the user.
*   **US-003: Basic Information Display**
    *   **As a user, after triggering the analysis, I want to see a confirmation and basic information from the scraped profile, so I know the extension processed it and it provides immediate value.**
        *   **AC-003.1:** A pop-up or overlay displays within a few seconds of successful scraping.
        *   **AC-003.2:** The display confirms the profile was processed (e.g., "Profile Read: [Profile Name]").
        *   **AC-003.3:** Display a few key pieces of scraped data (e.g., name, current headline) to demonstrate successful scraping and provide immediate, albeit basic, value.
*   **US-004: Extension Icon & Basic UI**
    *   **As a user, I want the extension to be easily accessible and unobtrusive, so it doesn't interfere with my normal browsing.**
        *   **AC-004.1:** The extension has a recognizable icon in the Chrome toolbar.
        *   **AC-004.2:** The display pop-up/overlay is dismissible and does not permanently obstruct page content.

### 5.2. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-001: Performance:**
    *   Scraping and displaying basic information should take no more than 5-10 seconds after user trigger.
    *   The extension should not noticeably degrade browser performance during normal LinkedIn browsing.
*   **NFR-002: Usability:**
    *   The extension should be intuitive to set up and use with minimal instructions.
*   **NFR-003: Privacy:**
    *   User's (optional) own profile URL data must be stored locally within the browser's extension storage.
    *   No user data should be transmitted to any third-party server for the MVP.
*   **NFR-004: Error Handling:**
    *   The extension should gracefully handle critical path errors (e.g., not on a LinkedIn profile page, fundamental scraping failure) and provide informative messages to the user. Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases is post-MVP.
*   **NFR-005: Security (Client-Side):**
    *   Scraping scripts should be carefully written to avoid common web vulnerabilities if they manipulate DOM or inject content (though display is primarily informational).
*   **NFR-006: Accessibility:**
    *   Basic accessibility considerations (e.g., keyboard operability for the extension's button, readable text) will be applied for MVP. Full WCAG compliance will be targeted post-MVP.

## 6. Technical Considerations

*   **Development Stack:** Standard Chrome extension technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   **LinkedIn Scraping:** Utilize Chrome extension content scripts to access and parse DOM of LinkedIn profile pages. Needs to be resilient to minor changes in LinkedIn's HTML structure.
*   **Data Storage:** `chrome.storage.local` for user's (optional) own profile URL and any settings.
*   **Permissions:** Will require permissions like `activeTab`, `storage`, and potentially host permissions for `linkedin.com`.

## 7. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

*   LLM integration for scoring.
*   Resume upload and parsing.
*   Secure handling of API keys for LLM.
*   More sophisticated scraping techniques.
*   User configurable scoring parameters.
*   History of analyzed profiles.
*   Options for users to provide feedback on score accuracy.
*   Comprehensive error handling.
*   Full accessibility compliance.

## 8. Open Questions

*   What specific data points from a LinkedIn profile are most critical for an initial "networking value" assessment by an LLM (for future planning)?
*   What are the most common variations in LinkedIn profile structures that the scraper needs to handle for MVP key data points?
*   How to best inform users about the limitations and potential biases of an AI-generated score, especially if it's a simplified version in early iterations (post-MVP)?
